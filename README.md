# General Description

"The Relax organisation runs a number of leisure centres. Each centre has a number of zones with 
leisure facilities. For safety and security purposes, Relax leisure centres require a system which both
controls access to its zones and keeps track of people in each zone. Access to a zone is through a 
door and to get through the door an access card is required. There are different types of cards for 
different kinds of members. All staff are also given membership of the centre and may use its 
facilities. When staff are working they have a by-pass key so do not need to use cards to get in/out 
of zones and are not recorded by the system. When not working, they will need to use their Staff 
membership access card"
